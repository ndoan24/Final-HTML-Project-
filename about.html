                        "<i><strong>Snowboarding</strong> is a winter sport that involves descending a slope that is
                            covered
                            with snow while standing on a board attached to a rider's feet, using a special boot set
                            onto a
                            mounted binding. The development of snowboarding was inspired by skateboarding, sledding,
                            surfing and skiing."</i></hic>

                        Snowboarding was thought to be a phase for rebelious young demographics. It was banned in the
                        1980s at ski resorts. Skiing is more dangerous than snowboarding like mentioned previously.

                        <br><br>It
                        quickly picked up soon after and became one of the fastest growing sports. Living in Colorado,
                        or visiting Colorado, snowboarding is someting you have to experience once in your life.
                        Colorado has the greatest mountains and air for the snowboarding. A lot of tourists however, do
                        we have trouble with the higher elevation but nonetheless, still a great experience.
